# **GEOmeta: Massive Labeled Transcriptomics Dataset**

This GitHub repository of GEO_GPT introduces "GEOmeta" from "Massive Labeled Transcriptomics as a Resource of Transcriptome Representation Learning". 
It is designed for building and querying GEO_Metadata to facilitate large-scale transcriptomics research and machine learning applications in biomedicine.
This project was developed by researchers at Michigan State University.




## **Repository Features or Resources**
This dataset includes:

- **100,000 human samples**
- **100,000 mouse samples**
- **Prompts:**
  - **Annotation prompts** to process raw metadata
  - **Standardization prompts** to generate machine-readable labels
- **Label Prediction Code**

## **Data File Name and Location**
- [HUMAN_METADATA](ANNOTATED_METADATA_HUMANSAMPLES.xlsx)
- [MOUSE_METADATA](ANNOTATED_METADATA_HUMANSAMPLES.xlsx)
- Prompts are stored in [`data/curation`](data/code/curation)foder.
-  **Code for label prediction** based on gene expression profiles is available in the [`data/benchmark`](data/code/benchmark) folder.
